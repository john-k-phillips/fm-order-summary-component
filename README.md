<h2>Satisfaction</h2>
<h3>The Good</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Placement of images.</li>
    <li>White spacing across the entire card.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The responsive design was rushed and I'm not satisfied with it.</li>
    <li>Git commits were all over the place and rushed. Something I don't normally do, It's important to me that I don't repeat this.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    Placing images via the object-fit / object-positioning, this was something I haven't actually practiced alot and I'm looking forward to working
    with images in future projects.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    I would like to change how the anchor elements are styled and potentially the border-shadow on the buttons.
